# Analyzing-Online-Sports-Revenue
Analyze product data for an online sports retail company to optimize revenue

# Description:
Sports clothing is a booming sector!

In this project you will use your Python skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.

You will work with a variety of data types to answer their questions about revenue, ratings, and product descriptions.

You will use techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, and labeling to answer key questions that will inform how the company can optimize their revenue!

# Project Instructions
In order to complete the project you will need to merge the datasets and drop null values, along with answering the questions below.

What is the volume of products and average revenue for Adidas and Nike products based on listing price quartiles?

Label products priced up to quartile one as "Budget", quartile two as "Average", quartile three as "Expensive", and quartile four as "Elite".
Store as a pandas DataFrame called adidas_vs_nike containing the following columns: "brand", "price_label", "num_products", and "mean_revenue". All numeric values should be rounded to two decimal places.

Do any differences exist between the word count of a product's description and its mean rating?

Split product description length into bins of 100 characters and calculate the average rating and number of reviews.
Store the results as a pandas DataFrame called description_lengths containing the following columns: "description_length", "mean_rating", "num_reviews", again rounding numeric values to two decimal places.
